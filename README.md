# indexed_list_view

Similar to a ListView, but:
* Lets you **programmatically jump to any item**, by index.
* The jump happens **instantly**, no matter if you have millions of items.
* It can also animate the scroll, instead of jumping.

## Limitations 
The list is always **_infinite_** both to positive and negative indexes.
In other words, it can be scrolled indefinitely both to the top and to the bottom.

In special, this is useful for implementing **calendars**, where you want to be able to jump to
specific dates, as calendars can be scrolled indefinitely, both to the past and future dates.

You can define index bounds by giving it a `minItemCount` and `maxItemCount`, but this will not
prevent the list from scrolling indefinitely. When showing items out of the index bounds, or when
your `itemBuilder` returns `null`, it will ask the `emptyItemBuilder` to create an "empty" item to
be displayed instead. As default, this will return empty containers.

## Usage

### Import the package

Add
indexed_list_view [as a dependency](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/indexed_list_view#-installing-tab-)
in your `pubspec.yaml` file, and then import it:

    import 'package:indexed_list_view/indexed_list_view.dart';

### Use the package

First, create an indexed scroll controller:

    var controller = IndexedScrollController();

Optionally, you may setup an initial index and/or initial scroll offset:

    var controller = IndexedScrollController(
        initialIndex: 75,
        initialScrollOffset : 30.0);    

Then, create the indexed list view, and pass it the controller:

    IndexedListView.builder(
        controller: controller, 
        itemBuilder: itemBuilder);

There is also the separated constructor, same as `ListView.separated`:

    IndexedListView.separated(
        controller: controller, 
        itemBuilder: itemBuilder,
        separatorBuilder: separatorBuilder);

To jump, use the controller methods like `jumpToIndex` :

    controller.jumpToIndex(10000);

## Details

The IndexedScrollController has not only an `offset` in pixels, but also an `origin-index` that
indicates which item is considered to be at the offset position `0.0`.

So there are two ways for you to move the list programmatically:
You can change only the `offset`, or else change the `originIndex` and the `offset` at the same
time.

To change the `originIndex` you make an "index jump". This jump is cheap, since it doesn't need to
build all widgets between the old and new positions. It will just change the origin.

If you want to move the list programmatically you must create a scroll controller of
type `IndexedScrollController`
and pass it in the list constructor. However, if all you need is an infinite list without jumps,
then there is no need to even create a controller.

You move the list programmatically by calling the controller methods.

## Controller Methods

1. `jumpToIndex(index)`

   The is the most common method for you to use. It jumps the origin-index to the given index, and
   the scroll-position to 0.0.

2. `jumpToIndexAndOffset(index, offset)`

   Jumps the origin-index to the given index, and the scroll-position to offset, without animation.

3. `animateToIndex(index)`

   If the current origin-index is already the same as the given index, animates the position from
   its current value to the offset position relative to the origin-index.

   However, if the current origin-index is different from the given index, this will jump to the new
   index, without any animation. In general, there are never animations when the index changes.

2. `animateToIndexAndOffset(index, offset)`

   Same as `animateToIndex()` but also lets you specify the new offset.

4. `jumpTo(offset)`

   Goes to origin-index "0", and then jumps the scroll position from its current value to the given
   offset, without animation.

4. `animateTo(offset)`

   If the current origin-index is already "0", animates the position from its current value to the
   offset position.

   However, if the current origin-index is different from "0", this will jump to index "0" and the
   given offset, without any animation. In general, there are never animations when the index
   changes.

5. `jumpToWithSameOriginIndex(offset)`

   Jumps the offset, relative to the current origin-index.

6. `animateToWithSameOriginIndex(offset)`

   Animates the offset, relative to the current origin-index.

7. `jumpToRelative(offset)`

   Jumps the offset, adding or subtracting from the current offset. It keeps the same origin-index.

8. `animateToRelative(offset)`

   Animates the offset, adding or subtracting from the current offset. It keeps the same
   origin-index.

Don't forget to check
the [example tab](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/indexed_list_view#-example-tab-). It shows an
infinite list of items of different heights, and you may tap buttons to run some of the methods
explained above.
